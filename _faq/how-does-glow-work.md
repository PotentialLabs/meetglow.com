Glow's breakthrough wireless sensor uses magneto-resistive sensing to measure the inductive fields created as energy flows through the meter box and into your home. This type of magneto-resistive sensing was first popularized for consumer use in smart phones, where it is used to sense the magnetic field of the earth for the compass app. Glow's sensor sends energy data wirelessly to the base unit where it is processed and sent to Glow's cloud service.

Glow analyzes your home’s energy usage to understand how and when you use energy. If you’re using more than normal, Glow turns amber, then red. When you’re saving money, it glows green. And when you have extended high usage, like if someone accidentally left the oven on or the A/C cranked, Glow sends you a helpful notification.
