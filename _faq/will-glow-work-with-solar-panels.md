Glow currently is planned to work with solar installations that include [EnPhase](http://enphase.com) inverter systems. For an EnPhase Solar PV system to integrate with Glow, it *must* be connected to the internet for solar output monitoring. If you'd like to be part of testing Glow's solar support, email us at [hello@meetglow.com](mailto:hello@meetglow.com).
