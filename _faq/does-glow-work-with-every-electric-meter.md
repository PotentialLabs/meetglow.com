Not yet. But it does work with the most common types.

Glow currently works with digital meters in the most common installation configurations:

You also might want to make sure your meter box has space for the Glow sensor. Here's an easy way to check:

The last thing to think about is **how far away your meter is from your home**. For instance, some meters are detached from the main structure, or a few floors away. If you can't get a good Wifi signal from your home's router at your meter, Glow's sensor probably won't be able to talk to the in-home unit.

We're always trying to improve our sensor technology to support more solutions. Sign up here to stay up to date when we support new meters.
