					<h2>Why Glow Matters</h2>
					<span class="byline">Integer sit amet pede vel arcu aliquet pretium</span>
				</header>
				<p>The price of energy has increased faster than inflation over the past 15 years and America’s residential housing stock, on average, wastes almost 40% of the energy that it’s occupants pay for each month. Together these factors translate into heightened energy cost to mainstream consumers.</p>
				<p>Additionally, in light of America pulling out of the Paris Agreement, it is more important than ever for individuals to make personal efforts to reduce their impact on the environment. Reduced energy use directly correlates to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from energy production.</p>
				<p>Glow is an easy first step that consumers can take towards combating waste, high cost, and the environmental impact of energy production.</p>
