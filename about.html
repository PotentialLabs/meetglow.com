		<h2>Why Glow Matters</h2>
	</header>
	<p>The price of energy has increased faster than inflation over the past 15 years and America’s residential housing stock, on average, wastes almost 40% of the energy that it’s occupants pay for each month. Together these factors translate into heightened energy cost to mainstream consumers.</p>
	<p>Additionally, it is more important than ever for individuals to make personal efforts to reduce their impact on the environment. Reduced energy use directly correlates to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from energy production.</p>
	<p>Glow is an easy first step that consumers can take towards combating waste, high cost, and the environmental impact of energy production.</p>
