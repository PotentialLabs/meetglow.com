### Who We Are

Potential Labs is a startup nestled in the hills of Southeast Ohio, part of the Appalachian region. We build solutions that help today’s consumers track how they use resources with the goal of reducing waste. Reducing waste saves money and has a positive effect on our environment.

### Glow

Glow is a smart energy tracker for the home. It gives users glowing real-time feedback about their energy use, leading to energy savings and reduced impact on the environment. Glow’s breakthrough inductive wireless sensor allows anyone to install it in just a few minutes. The device provides simple on-the-go energy monitoring and smart budgeting tools from its companion mobile app. It also alerts users about extended high usage, which could be dangerous, sending a notification to their phone.

### Features

- Glowing indicator of real-time energy use
- Learns about users' homes and tailors feedback to be helpful
- Mobile push notifications alert users of high usage
- Simple energy cost forecast and smart budgeting
- Mobile app for detailed data exploration
- Ambient light sensor dynamically adjusts indicator brightness
- Snooze button for temporarily pausing glowing feedback
- Uses just 6 Watts, less than an LED light bulb.

### How Glow Works

Glow's breakthrough wireless sensor uses magneto-resistive sensing to measure the inductive magnetic fields created as energy flows through the meter box and into the home. This type of magneto-resistive sensing was first popularized for consumer use in smart phones, where it was used to sense the magnetic field of the earth for the compass app. Glow's sensor sends energy data wirelessly to the base unit where it is processed and sent to Glow's cloud service.

Glow analyzes a home’s energy use data to understand how and when it uses energy. If it's using more than normal, Glow turns amber, then red. When a home is saving money, Glow turns green. And if there is extended high usage, like if someone accidentally left the oven or coffee pot on, or the fridge door open, Glow sends a helpful push notification to the user's phone.

### Why Glow Matters

Over the past 15 years, the price of energy has consistently outpaced inflation. Meanwhile, America’s residential homes, on average, waste almost 40% of the energy that their occupants pay for. These factors translate into energy costs for mainstream consumers that more than two thirds (68%) say they feel is exorbitant.

Additionally, in light of America pulling out of the Paris Agreement, it is more important than ever for individuals to make personal efforts to reduce their impact on the environment. Reduced energy use directly correlates to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from energy production.

Glow is an easy first step that consumers can take towards combating waste, high cost, and the environmental impact of energy production.

### Quote

> “What we came to realize, is that being **in the home** is just as important as tracking data **about it**. Glow becomes part of your life, not just another app.”
