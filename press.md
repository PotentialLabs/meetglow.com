Glow is a smart energy tracker for the home. It gives users glowing real-time feedback about their energy use leading to energy savings and reduced impact on the environment. Glow’s breakthrough inductive wireless sensor allows anyone to install it in just a few minutes. The device provides simple on-the-go energy monitoring and smart budgeting tools from the companion mobile app. It will also alert users about extended high usage, that could be dangerous, by sending a notification to their phone.

### Features

- Glowing indicator of real-time energy use
- Mobile push notifications alert users of high usage
- Simple energy cost forecast and smart budgeting
- Mobile app for detailed data
- Ambient light sensor dynamically adjusts indicator brightness
- Snooze button for temporarily pausing glowing indicator
- Runs on just 6 Watts, less than a LED light bulb.

### Why Glow Matters

Over the past 15 years, the price of energy has consistently outpaced inflation. Meanwhile, America’s residential homes, on average, waste almost 40% of the energy that their occupants pay for. These factors translate into energy costs for mainstream consumers that more than two thirds (68%) say feel is exorbitant.

Additionally, in light of America pulling out of the Paris Agreement, it is more important than ever for individuals to make personal efforts to reduce their impact on the environment. Reduced energy use directly correlates to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from energy production.

Glow is an easy first step that consumers can take towards combating waste, high cost, and the environmental impact of energy production.
